# Minimum Operations

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a method that calculates the minimum number of operations required to generate exactly `n` 'H' characters in a text file, starting with a single 'H'. The text editor can perform only two operations: `Copy All` and `Paste`.

## Problem Statement

### Task
You need to write a method `minOperations(n)` that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to obtain exactly `n` 'H' characters in the text file.

### Prototype
```python
def minOperations(n):
    # Your code here
```

### Return Value
- **Returns:** An integer representing the minimum number of operations.
- **If `n` is impossible to achieve, return `0`.**

### Example
```python
n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6
```

## How to Approach the Problem

To solve this problem, you need to understand that the operations required to reach `n` are related to the factors of `n`. The solution involves breaking down `n` into its prime factors and summing them, as each factor represents a sequence of `Copy All` and `Paste` operations.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Factorization**: Factorize `n` to identify the sequence of multiplications that lead to `n`.
2. **Count Operations**: The number of operations needed is the sum of these factors.

### Example Walkthrough:
- For `n = 9`, the prime factorization is `3 x 3`.
  - Operation sequence:
    1. `Copy All` (from 1 'H') + `Paste` (2 'H's)
    2. `Paste` (3 'H's)
    3. `Copy All` (from 3 'H's) + `Paste` (6 'H's)
    4. `Paste` (9 'H's)
  - Total operations: `6`.

### Edge Cases:
- If `n = 1`, no operation is needed, so return `0`.
- If `n` is a prime number, the solution involves copying and pasting one character repeatedly until `n` is reached.

## Implementation

Hereâ€™s a basic implementation of the `minOperations` function:

```python
def minOperations(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    
    operations = 0
    factor = 2
    
    while n > 1:
        while n % factor == 0:
            operations += factor
            n //= factor
        factor += 1
    
    return operations
```

### Explanation:
- Start with `factor = 2`.
- Repeatedly divide `n` by the smallest possible factor, adding that factor to the operations count.
- Continue until `n` is reduced to `1`.

## Conclusion

The `minOperations` function is designed to compute the minimum number of operations required to obtain exactly `n` 'H' characters by leveraging the prime factorization of `n`. This method ensures efficiency and correctness, even for large values of `n`.
