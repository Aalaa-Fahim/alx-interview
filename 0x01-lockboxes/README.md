# Lockboxes

## Overview

This project involves developing a solution to determine if all boxes in a given list can be opened.
Each box may contain keys to other boxes, and the objective is to verify if it is possible to access every box starting from the first one.

## Problem Description

You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1`, and each box may contain keys to the other boxes. Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

### Prototype
```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    # Your code here
```

- `boxes` is a list of lists.
- A key with the same number as a box opens that box.
- You can assume all keys will be positive integers.
- There can be keys that do not have boxes.
- The first box `boxes[0]` is unlocked.
- Return `True` if all boxes can be opened, else return `False`.

## Key Concepts and Resources

To efficiently solve this problem, a solid understanding of several key concepts is required. Below is a list of these concepts along with recommended resources:

### Lists and List Manipulation
Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.

- [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

### Graph Theory Basics
Knowledge of graph theory, especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), can be very helpful. The boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.

### Algorithmic Complexity
Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important for writing more efficient algorithms.

- [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-1-asymptotic-analysis/)

### Recursion
Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.

- [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)

### Queue and Stack
Knowledge of using queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a BFS or DFS algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.

- [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/)
- [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-in-python/)

### Set Operations
Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.

- [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)

## Implementation

Here is a high-level approach to implement the `canUnlockAll` method:

1. **Initialize a Set for Keys**: Start with the key for the first box.
2. **Track Visited Boxes**: Use a set to keep track of visited boxes.
3. **Use a Stack/Queue**: Implement DFS or BFS to traverse the boxes using a stack or queue.
4. **Traverse**: For each key, check if the corresponding box has been opened. If not, open it and add any new keys to the set.
5. **Check All Boxes**: At the end, if all boxes have been visited, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

## Example

```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    if not boxes:
        return False

    n = len(boxes)
    visited = set()
    keys = set([0])

    while keys:
        key = keys.pop()
        if key not in visited:
            visited.add(key)
            keys.update(boxes[key])

    return len(visited) == n
```

This implementation uses a set to store keys and a while loop to simulate the process of opening boxes and collecting new keys.

## Conclusion

By reviewing these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.
