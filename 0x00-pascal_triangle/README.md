## Introduction to Pascal's Triangle
Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it. The triangle is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, though it was known to mathematicians centuries before him in India, Persia, China, and Italy.

### Structure of Pascal's Triangle
- The topmost row is the 0th row and contains a single 1.
- The 1st row contains two 1s.
- Each subsequent row starts and ends with 1.
- Every other number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Here is the beginning of Pascal's Triangle:

```
        1
      1   1
    1   2   1
  1   3   3   1
1   4   6   4   1
```

## Why Pascal's Triangle is Important
Pascal's Triangle has applications in algebra, probability, and combinatorics. Some key points include:
- Binomial Expansions: The coefficients of the expanded form of \((a + b)^n\) are the elements of the nth row of Pascal's Triangle.
- Combinations: The value at the nth row and kth column is \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents combinations in combinatorics.
- Fibonacci Sequence: Diagonal sums of Pascal's Triangle generate Fibonacci numbers.

## Generating Pascal's Triangle in Python
To generate Pascal's Triangle in Python, we can use a simple function that iterates through the rows and columns, summing up the appropriate values.

### Python Implementation
Here's a basic Python function to generate Pascal's Triangle:

```python
def generate_pascals_triangle(n):
    triangle = [[1]]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        row = [1]
        for j in range(1, i):
            row.append(triangle[i-1][j-1] + triangle[i-1][j])
        row.append(1)
        triangle.append(row)
    
    return triangle

def print_pascals_triangle(triangle):
    for row in triangle:
        print(' '.join(map(str, row)).center(2*n))

n = 5
triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(n)
print_pascals_triangle(triangle)
```

### Explanation
- The `generate_pascals_triangle` function initializes the triangle with the first row `[1]`.
- It then iterates through the desired number of rows, calculating each row based on the previous row.
- The `print_pascals_triangle` function prints the triangle in a visually appealing format.

## Examples and Exercises

### Example
Generate and print the first 5 rows of Pascal's Triangle.

```python
n = 5
triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(n)
print_pascals_triangle(triangle)
```

### Exercises
1. Modify the function to generate Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row, where n is provided by the user.
2. Write a function to calculate the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\) using Pascal's Triangle.
3. Implement a function to find the Fibonacci sequence using Pascal's Triangle.
